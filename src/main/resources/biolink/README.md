# Biolink mappings

CAM-KP needs Biolink information in both the triplestore backend as well as the 
frontend. This is frustrating -- if only one of them needed to know about the
Biolink model, that would greatly simplify what we need to do here.

At the moment, we have files outside this directory that I don't want to clean up
tonight, but that I will get to this soon.

This directory represents a separate attempt at doing this: taking all of our predicate
mapping logic and putting it into one place, and attempting to set it up so that this
entire thing can be queried from the triplestore in such a way that we can change Biolink
versions in the triplestore without affecting the front end at all.

The contents of this directory can be regenerated by updating the Biolink version in application.conf
and then running:

```shell
$ SPARQL_ENDPOINT=https://cam-kp-sparql-dev.apps.renci.org/sparql sbt "runMain org.renci.cam.util.GenerateBiolinkPredicateMappings"
```
